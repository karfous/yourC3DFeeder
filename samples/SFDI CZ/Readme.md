# About the sample

Simple example how you can define elements based on [road standard](https://sfdi.gov.cz/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ds-sfdi-silnicni-stavby.xlsx) from Czech public authority called [SFDI](https://sfdi.gov.cz/bim/metodiky-bim/).

## ðŸ’› Make it run

This sample contains only JSONC definition of property sets. You can process the JSONC file with the [script yourC3DFeeder.dyn from Corridor sample](../corridor/input/) . For the whole process you need also property sets defined in dwg file but this is not part of the sample.
