# Dynamo Civil 3D Feeder

Dynamo Feeder is a lightweight framework that allows you to add property sets with property values to any AutoCAD or Civil 3D model space object based on AutoCAD layers.

## ❓ About the workflow

I was wondering how can I easily add metadata to AutoCAD or Civil 3D objects. You can use some 3rd party tools for this task of course but Dynamo seemed to be enough with packages and nodes already provided.

### 🔪 I wanted

- to define corridor
- to use it as data shortcut
- to generate solids (dynamicaly connected)
- to add property sets and values with one button
- to have this possibility on every project

## 💯 Install

- Check out the [/package Readme](./package/Readme.md) for details.

### 🙏 How to start

I have prepared some samples for you, so you fully understand the principle.

- Check out the [corridor sample](./samples/corridor/Readme.md) for more details.
